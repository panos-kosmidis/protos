# Protos [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/derdesign/protos.png)](http://travis-ci.org/derdesign/protos)

Protos is an open source Web Application Development framework, focused on high performance, integration, ease of 
deployment, maintainability and security. Protos runs on UNIX-like systems such as **Linux** &amp; **Mac OSX**. Windows 
support might be added in the future.

**Note**: _The framework is under moderate development and the API and internal methods/functionality may change. The documentation
may also contain topics that have been removed, and may not contain all the features the framework provides._

## Development Stack

Protos provides a set of APIs that allow the framework to be extended in all sorts of ways. Use it either to contribute
new functionality &amp; components to it, or to enhance it with the needs of your team/organization.

### Drivers

You have at your disposal the _Database Drivers_, which provide a common set of methods to operate the backend database,
implementing the _Models API_, which allows the Driver to connect with _Models_.

### Storages

_Storages_ are used for caching, session data and anything you can think of. These abstract databases with fast read/write 
operations, such as MongoDB and Redis. Storages are also used as the _caching layer_ for Drivers on the _Query Cache_ functionality.

### Models

Models use Drivers under the hood to handle the low level manipulation of their data. They provide automatic validation of data.
You can set your own validation rules with ease on a per-model basis.

The Models can relate with eaach other by using Relationships. These are used to connect models in specific ways, storing only the
references to their related models. You can then retrieve the related models either individually, or in groups.

Each relationship add a set predefined methods using a common convention, that help you maniuplate the relationships between
the model objects you're working with.

Model (and Relationships) database-agnostic, you can change the underlying database driver used by the model, and no changes are required. This
means you can use a database backend for development, and another for production (just to give an example). No changes needed on deployment.

### Overview

Here's the Development Stack the framework provides, in a nutshell:

- **Drivers** &nbsp; _[MongoDB](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/drivers/mongodb.js), [MySQL](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/drivers/mysql.js)_
- **Storages** &nbsp; _[MongoDB](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/storages/mongodb.js), [Redis](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/storages/redis.js)_
- **Models** &nbsp; _Use any Driver supported_
- **Query Cache (Drivers)** &nbsp; _Use any Storage supported_
- **Query Cache (Models)** &nbsp; _Handled by underlying Driver_
- **Caching** &nbsp; _Use any Storage supported_
- **Sessions** &nbsp; _Use any Storage supported_
- **Response Caching** &nbsp; _Use any Storage supported_
- **Logging** &nbsp; _[MongoDB](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/middleware/logger/transport-mongodb.js), 
[Redis](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/middleware/logger/transport-redis.js) (additionally 
[File](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/middleware/logger/transport-file.js), [Console](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/middleware/logger/transport-console.js) via Middleware)_

To install the driver & storage component dependencies, use the `protos install <component>` command. For a full list of components and
their dependencies, see the [dependencies.json](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/dependencies.json) file.

## Middleware

The Application's functionality can be extended with the following (ready to use) components:

- [asset_compiler](/middleware#asset_compiler) &nbsp; *Compiles LESS, Stylus and CoffeeScript, Supports Watch/Compress/Minify.*
- [aws](http://protos.org/middleware#aws) &nbsp; *Amazon Web Services support. Provides clients to all services (ES3, EC2, etc)*

To install the middleware dependencies, use the `protos install <middleware>` command. For a full list of components and
their dependencies, see the [dependencies.json](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/dependencies.json) file.

## Template Engines

There is a lot of flexibility when it comes to template engines. To use a view engine, just add the extension 
to the template and you're set. You don't need to install any npm dependencies.

View Partials can be used across template engines. This means you can use Jade partials within Swig templates. Or CoffeeKup
partials within EJS templates (and vice versa). There are a few exceptions with mustache engines (due to their *logicless*
nature), such as Hogan and Handlebars.

You are not limited by the default view extensions the framework provides. You can specify your own view extensions in the
application's configuration.

The following view engine components are provided by protos:

- [CoffeeKup](https://github.com/mauricemach/coffeekup)
- [DoT](https://github.com/olado/doT)
- [Eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco)
- [EJS](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs)
- [Haml](https://github.com/visionmedia/haml.js)
- [Haml-Coffee](https://github.com/9elements/haml-coffee)
- [Handlebars](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js)
- [Hogan.js](https://github.com/twitter/hogan.js)
- [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade)
- [Jazz](https://github.com/shinetech/jazz)
- [JQuery Templates](https://github.com/kof/node-jqtpl)
- [JSHtml](https://github.com/LuvDaSun/jshtml)
- [Kernel](https://github.com/c9/kernel)
- [Liquor](https://github.com/chjj/liquor)
- [Swig](https://github.com/paularmstrong/swig)

To install the engine dependencies, use the `protos install <engine>` command. For a full list of components and
their dependencies, see the [dependencies.json](https://github.com/derdesign/protos/blob/master/dependencies.json) file.
